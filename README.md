# UnblockMe-solver

A program to find a step-by-step solution to any `Unblock Me` puzzle, given the initial arrangement of blocks.

<p>The solver is available in two modes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Terminal mode : </strong>The data has to be fed to the program manually from the terminal.
<strong>This makes it rather cumbersome</strong>

But for terminal-lovers, it is the ideal 'mode'</li>
<li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode : </strong>The initial configuration has to be supplied via mouse clicks.
<strong>This mode is very quick and easy-to-use</strong>

It is the preferrable mode for lazy people (like me!).</li></ul>

## Setup and execution
Download or clone the repository to your machine. `cd` into the directory and then open the terminal.

Type the following command in the terminal to compile the source code:

```bash configure.sh```

Then type this command to run the program:

```bash run.sh```

## Future prospects
Implementing auto-detection of blocks from image captured through webcam and feeding the detected information directly to the solver
