<h1>UnblockMe-solver</h1>

<p>A program to find a step-by-step solution to any "Unblock Me" puzzle, given the initial arrangement of blocks.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The solver is available in two modes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Terminal mode : </strong>The data has to be fed to the program manually from the terminal.<br><h3>This makes it rather cumbersome</h3><br>But for terminal-lovers, it is the ideal 'mode'</li>
<li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode : </strong>The initial configuration has to be supplied via mouse clicks.<br><h3>This mode is very quick and easy-to-use</h3><br>It is the preferrable mode for lazy people (like me!).</li></ul>

<h2>Setup and execution</h2>
<p>Download or clone the repository to your machine. 'cd' into the directory and then open the terminal.<br>Type the following command in the terminal to compile the source code:<br>
'''bash configure.sh'''
Then type this command to run the program:<br>
'''bash run.sh'''

<h2>Future prospects</h2>
Implementing auto-detection of blocks from image captured through webcam and feeding the detected information directly to the solver
